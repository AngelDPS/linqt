Lin\+QT is a tools which allows performing quantum transport calculations in tight-\/binding models. Lin\+QT possess interfaces with other tight-\/binding modelling packages such as {\bfseries Wannier90,} or {\bfseries K\+W\+A\+NT} and Tbmodel. Its core is written in C++ and uses open\+MP and M\+PI for optimized calculations.

Lin\+QT allows for the following kind of calculations\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Nonequilibrium electrical response of different operators within the linear regime. Some particular examples are\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The conductivity.
\item The spin Hall conductivity.
\item The spin susceptibility.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Time-\/correlation which are the basis for computing\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The Mean-\/square spreading.
\item \hyperlink{spinrelaxation}{The spin relaxation times}.
