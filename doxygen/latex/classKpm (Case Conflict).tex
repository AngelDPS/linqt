A multi-\/purpose class for \hyperlink{classKPM}{K\+PM} calculations.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$kpm.\+hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
A multi-\/purpose class for \hyperlink{classKPM}{K\+PM} calculations. 

This class is aimed to served as a multi-\/purpose class for \hyperlink{classKPM}{K\+PM} approximation of spectral quantities. It defines specialized linear algebra operations and memory allocation used for an efficient performance of large scale calculations.
