Defines the Regular Hamiltonian Class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$lattice.\+hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the Regular Hamiltonian Class. 

Defines the Irregular Hamiltonian Class

This header defines the lattice\+\_\+index class  Remove it and incorporate it in a appropiate vector class

This is a system-\/specific field that defines the parameters of the lattice

A multi-\/purpose tight-\/binding lattice class

This class is aimed to served as a multipurpose tight-\/binding lattice class, which can be used to store different model for tight-\/binding hamiltonians, it\textquotesingle{}s geometrical properties, hoppings and other variables. It serve as a host of the irregular and regular part of the hamiltonian also.
